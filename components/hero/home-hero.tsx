              <p className="content">
                If it's not obvious by now -- my name is Eric Quelch. I'm a
                software developer currently living in London, Ontario. I'm a
                born and raised Canadian boy, and I love Hockey if you haven't
                made that assumption yet. Big Toronto Maple Leaf's fan.
              </p>
              <p className="content">
                I'm a huge geek. I guess I'm not your stereotypical geek, and I
                think that surprises people at times with random facts about
                this and that.
              </p>
              <p className="content">
                I love tinkering with things on my computer to my cars. I think
                that's what made me want to pursue a career as a developer.
              </p>

                Over the past four years, I have pursued an education to perfect
                my craft. I have earned a diploma in Internet Applications and
                Web Development and continue to improve each day. One of my
                biggest problems is I struggle to put my computer down to stop
                working or learning something. Ask my wife she gets a kick out
                of it ðŸ¤£

                I could cover a lot about myself, but that would be too long of
                a read. If you want to know more about me! Feel free to drop a
                message on my
