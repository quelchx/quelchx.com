              <p className="content">
                If it's not obvious by now, my name is Eric Quelch. Im a
                software developer who is currently living in London, Ontario
                Canada. I'm a born and raised Canadian boy, and yes I absolutely
                love Hockey if you haven't made that assumption yet. Big Toronto
                Maple Leafs fan... go Leafs go!
              </p>
              <p className="content">
                I'm a huge geek. I guess I'm not your sterotypical geek, I tend
                to suprise people at times with random facts about this and
                that.
              </p>
              <p className="content">
                I absolutely love tinkering with things on my computer to my
                cars. Saying that, I think that's what made me want to pursue a
                career as a developer.

                Over the past four years I have been pursing an education
                perfecting my craft. I have earned a diploma in Internet
                Applications and Web Development and contunie to learn new
                things each day. One of my biggest problems is I have trouble
                putting my computer down to stop working on something. Ask my
                wife she gets a kick out of it ðŸ¤£
